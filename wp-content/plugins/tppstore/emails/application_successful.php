        <td>
            <p style="color:#777777;">Once you've created your listings please share your store on your blog, website and social media outlets. It would also be great if you shared the link when you get questions emailed in from up and coming photographers asking you about your kit etc - a great chance to make a sale from someone who evidently admires your style and business! Attached is a store button you can use wherever you'd like to online.</p>

            <p style="color:#777777;">A quick note about sales... We're planning on inviting sellers to participate in our site wide sales at various points in the year - you can set discounts in your dashboard area. Make sure you have signed up to be on our sellers mailing list so you'll hear about when our planned sales times are and we'll include you in our sales mail outs and promotions. You can also set flash sales - let us know if you'd like to plan one of these as we'd like to help promote your sale heavily over our blog and social media.</p>

            <p style="color:#777777;">So to get started now all you need to do is create some listings! These could be anything from a mentor session or future workshops, an ebook you've been working on or your own photoshop actions etc. If we don't have a category for what you want to list please tell us as we are always developing the site and keen to work with you to make it the number one photography site on the web!</p>
